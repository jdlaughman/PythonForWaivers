Code examples written in python to demonstrate proficiency in object-oriented programming

This repository is a list of python exercies to demonstrate a basic proficiency level in object oriented porgramming. All examples can be executed as working code except for the API example. The API example can only be reviewed because the personal API key was ommitted.

Short explanation of each file follows below

W_GenerateDice.py - Use lists, for loops and while to create virtual set of dice that can be rerolled

W_SimpleRPG.py - Use classes and dictionaries to create a role-playing character that battles a randomly selected enemy

W_NormalEquationForLinear.py - Use matrix multiplicaiton via numpy module and matplotlib to caluclate and display linear regression intercept and coefficient

W_SciKitForLinear.py - Generate same linear regression coefficient (with same data set) as W_NormalEquationForLinear.py by using sklearn module approach

W_APIconnections.py - Demonstrate ability to read API documentaiton and use requests modules to interact with Microsoft Azure
