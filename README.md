Code examples written in python to demonstrate proficiency in object-oriented programming

This repository is a list of python exercies to demonstrate a basic proficiency level in object oriented porgramming.

All examples can be executed as working code in any IDE that supports python (Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, etc) *except* for the API example. The API example will not execute because the personal API key was ommitted.  Also, no image / image file path is included.

Short explanation of each file follows below

W_GenerateDice.py - Use lists, for loops and while to create virtual set of dice that can be rerolled

W_SimpleRPG.py - Use classes and dictionaries to create a role-playing character that battles a randomly selected enemy

W_NormalEquationForLinear.py - Use matrix multiplicaiton via numpy module and matplotlib to caluclate and display linear regression intercept and coefficient.  The output focuses on plotting a chart that includes the intercept and coefficient.

W_SciKitForLinear.py - Generate same linear regression coefficient (with same data set) as W_NormalEquationForLinear.py by using sklearn module approach with pandas DataFrames.  The output focuses on displaying the coefficients and then providing predicitons

W_APIconnections.py - Demonstrate ability to read API documentaiton and use requests modules to interact with Microsoft Azure.  This code will not execute as API key is excluded.  Also, the image file path is excluded.  The code would execute if these two values were valid.  In its current form, is only to demonstrate an understanding with how to interact with an API
